## Course: Application Prototyping   
**Tools Used:** Figma, Miro, Lucidchart, Notion, C4 Model, Example Mapping

---

### Project Overview  
This was a **concept design project** from the second semester of my **Applied Computer Science** degree. The challenge was based on a **fictional brief by the city of Bruges**, which aimed to reduce traffic stress for young parents by introducing a **self-driving bus service for toddlers and pre-schoolers**.

The project was heavily focused on **conceptual design and prototyping**, rather than implementation. The core goal was to build a system that people could **trust**, even without a driver. This meant addressing not just technical challenges, but also **emotional factors** like child comfort and parental anxiety.

### Key Components I Designed  

- **Stakeholder-focused user stories**  
  Covered the perspectives of **parents, schools, city officials, and kids**.

- **Example Mapping**  
  Tackled complex edge cases like **children from separated households**.

- **UML-Based Use Case Diagram (UCD)**  
  Captured roles and key system interactions.

- **Flowcharts**  
  Mapped out critical flows like **home pickup**, **emergency rerouting**, and **school drop-off**.

- **C4 Diagrams**  
  Visualized system architecture: **Context**, **Containers**, and **Components**.

- **Smart Wearable Proposal**  
  Embedded system to track **boarding status** and **child location**.

- **Mobile UI Wireframes**  
  For **parents**, plus a **monitoring dashboard** for the city.

### ⚖Ethical & Functional Considerations  

- Balanced **surveillance vs. privacy** and made thoughtful decisions around **data handling**.  
- Developed a **custom authentication model**: no public registration; access is granted via schools or the city.  
- Defined clear logic for **pickup point eligibility**, **trial periods**, and **payment models**.

### Key Takeaways  
This project helped me understand how to design for **trust**, not just functionality—especially in a high-stakes context involving **children and automation**.

It brought together:
- **User-centered design**
- **System architecture**
- **Ethical reasoning**

into one coherent and meaningful solution.
